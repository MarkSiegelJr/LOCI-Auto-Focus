# LOCI-Auto-Focus
"Notebook" for progress on algorithm to automatically focus microscope as it scans across a slide, aquiring images.

Instead of just keeping a detailed notebook with the progress made at LOCI, it was decided that I should also use GitHub to track progress, as I can easily commit any changes to code to a single repository for easy access later, complete with dates the commits were made. This is becuse the vast majority of the work done for this project is programming, which is difficult to convey in a handwritten notebook.
